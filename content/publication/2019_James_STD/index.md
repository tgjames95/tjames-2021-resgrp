abstract: 'Survey data from a university in the southeast United States were used to estimate the relation between sexual risk factors, perceived susceptibility, and human immunodeficiency virus testing intention among sexually active college students who had never been tested. Sexual risk factors, but not knowledge, were indirectly related to increased human immunodeficiency virus testing intention through perceived susceptibility.'
