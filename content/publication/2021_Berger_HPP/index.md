abstract: 'HIV-related stigma remains a considerable barrier to engaging at-risk populations in HIV testing and prevention programs. We assessed the moderating role of HIV-related stigma on the relation between perceived susceptibility to HIV and HIV testing intention among college students. We hypothesized that the moderating role of HIV-related stigma would be differential between heterosexual and sexual minority college students. We administered a survey focused on HIV-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors in Spring 2016 (N = 2,159). We used multi-group path analysis to analyze the hypothesized moderation. HIV-related stigma moderated the relation between perceived susceptibility and testing intention for heterosexual, but not sexual minority college students. Specifically, higher HIV-related stigma decreased the association between perceived susceptibility and testing intention. These results demonstrate the importance of priority population segmentation for HIV testing campaigns.'

## **What is this paper about?**	
HIV affects about 1.2 million people in the United States. To reduce transmission of HIV, public health specialists create health communication campaigns to encourage people to get tested for HIV. One way to encourage people to get tested for HIV is to change their perception of their risk behavior (called perceived susceptibility). People who feel at risk for getting HIV are more likely to get tested. However, HIV-related stigma is a barrier to HIV testing. 

In this paper, we analyzed data from college students to identify differences in the role of stigma and perceived susceptibility on intention to get tested for HIV among straight (heterosexual) and sexual minority (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, etc.) college students. Our results indicate that stigma reduces the positive influence of perceived susceptibility on HIV testing intention for heterosexual but not sexual minority college students. Public health specialists should make sure that health communication campaigns address HIV-related stigma as a barrier for heterosexual students. <br>
