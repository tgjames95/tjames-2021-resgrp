abstract: 'Deaf people who use American Sign Language (ASL) are more likely to use the emergency
department (ED) than their hearing English-speaking counterparts, and are also at higher risk of receiving inaccessible communication. The purpose of this study is to explore the ED communication experience of Deaf patients. A descriptive qualitative study was performed by interviewing 11 Deaf people who had used the ED in the past two years. Applying a descriptive thematic analysis, we developed five themes: (1) requesting communication access can be stressful, frustrating, and time-consuming; (2) perspectives and experiences with Video Remote Interpreting (VRI); (3) expectations, benefits, and drawbacks of using on-site ASL interpreters; (4) written and oral communication provides insufficient information to Deaf patients; and, (5) ED staff and providers lack cultural sensitivity and awareness towards Deaf patients. Findings are discussed with respect to medical and interpreting ethics to improve ED communication for Deaf patients.'

## **What is this paper about?**	
This paper reports the results of a survey of Deaf people in Florida. The survey was administered in 2018. In total, 92 Deaf people who use American Sign Language to communicate completed the survey. 

## **How does this paper improve public health?**
There is a lack of research on the health of Deaf people in the United States. Most of the existing research is funded by large grants. We identify three major priorities for improving the health of Deaf people in Florida: focus on access to mental health services and improving mental health, stress, and anxiety reduction; reduce the occurence of drinking a lot of alcohol in one period of time; and,  improving access to ASL interpreters in medical facilities. 
## **How was the community involved?**
Members of the Florida Deaf community helped make decisions about this project. We had a team of Deaf community members, Deaf researchers, and non-Deaf researchers. Deaf community members helped us decide survey questions, translate the survey, recruit participants, and write manuscripts. They are included as authors on the paper. In addition, we acknowledge the support of organizations including the Florida Association of the Deaf, regional Deaf-led organizations, and the Florida Disability and Health Program.
