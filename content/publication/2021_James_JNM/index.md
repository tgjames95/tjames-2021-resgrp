abstract: '[Note: This article has been accepted and is in press, scheduled to be published in 2021.] *Background:* College students are a priority population for health insurance literacy interventions. Yet, there are few psychometric studies on measuring health insurance knowledge-a core construct of health insurance literacy. *Methods:* We administered a health insurance survey to 2,250 college students. We applied Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory methods to estimate psychometric properties of the Kaiser Family Foundation’s 10-item health insurance knowledge quiz. *Results:* The scale is unidimensional, and a two-parameter logistic model best fit the data. IRT estimates indicated varying item discriminations (*a* range: 0.717 to 2.578) and difficulties (*b* range: -0.913 to 1.790). Precision of measurement was maximized for students half a standard deviation below the mean (θ = -0.686) health insurance knowledge ability. *Conclusions:* This scale can be used to identify gaps in health insurance knowledge among college students and be applied in clinical and community health education practice.'

## **What is this paper about?**	
People who have health insurance still report difficulty affording healthcare. Healthcare in the U.S. is very complex: copays, deductibles, premiums, etc. Health insurance literacy describes a person's ablity to choose, use, and understand their health insurance plan. A good understanding of health insurance can help people make better, more affordable, healthcare decisions. This paper focuses on how researchers measure health insurance knowledge. We collected data using a survey of college students to assess a 10-question quiz developed by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

## **How does this paper improve public health?**
Health insurance literacy has recently become an important concept in research. However, we need survey tools to accurately measure health insurance knowledge. Our statistical analysis provides evidence that the 10-question quiz can be used to measure knowledge about health insurance among college students. This means that the questions can be used for future research, or creating health programs.
