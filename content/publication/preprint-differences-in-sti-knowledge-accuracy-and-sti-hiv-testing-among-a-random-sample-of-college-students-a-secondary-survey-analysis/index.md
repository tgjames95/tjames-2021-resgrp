*Objective:* This study aimed to describe STI knowledge accuracy and STI/HIV testing service use in college students. *Participants:* A random sample of 991 university students aged 18-24, enrolled at a major public university, participated in this study in February 2009. *Methods:* Students took a survey designed by researchers in college health promotion and sexual health. Survey responses were examined for differences in STI knowledge accuracy, and demographic and behavioral predispositions to getting an STI or HIV test. *Results:* STI knowledge and testing service use differed significantly by gender, race, sexual orientation, STI/HIV testing history, and being sexually active in the past year. *Conclusions:* These findings can inform health communication campaigns of specific populations to target by providing identifiable sub-groups lacking STI knowledge and not using testing services.
