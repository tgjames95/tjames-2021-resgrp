abstract: 'Objective: The objective of this study was to examine clinical and epidemiological information collected by Student Health Center (SHC) providers on HIV-positive students, and benchmark this information against Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines. Participants: Students who utilized the SHC and had an ICD-9 code indicating positive HIV status between 2005 and 2015 (3 = 7). Methods: In June 2016, we accessed the free-form provider notes of the SHC’s electronic medical records to identify specific, recorded epidemiological and clinical information. Results: Seven unique students sought care at the SHC during the study period. Current sexual risk taking and other known behavioral risk factors were absent from all records, along with CD4 count and viral load. ART status was only available for one patient, and he was not on ART. The information collected failed to meet IDSA benchmarks. Conclusion: Clinically- and epidemiologically-relevant information is not systematically collected from HIV-positive students at SHCs.'
