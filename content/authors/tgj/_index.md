I am a health education scientist, [Certified Health Education Specialist](http://nchec.org/), and Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Michigan in the Department of Family Medicine. At the University of Michigan, I am working with the [Center for Disability Health and Wellness](https://disabilityhealth.medicine.umich.edu/) and the [Michigan Mixed Methods Program](http://mixedmethods.org) to apply quantitative methods - including Latent Class Analysis and Latent Profile Analysis, time-varying effect modeling, structural equation modeling, and psychometrics -, qualitative methods, and mixed methods to (1) develop, refine, and advance health behavior theory and measurement, and (2) reduce health disparities - particularly those caused by inequities in health services utilization and delivery - among priority populations.
